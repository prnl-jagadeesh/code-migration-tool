Google Product Areas (PAs) such as Ads, Search,
Workspace and YouTube are mature software development
organizations that perhaps resemble many Fortune 500 com-
panies in terms of software development challenges:

• Mature (20+ years), large code bases.

• Need to keep up with business demands for agility in a
competitive external environment.

• Need to maintain code and use new frameworks etc. to
ascertain current feature demands.

• Software development quality and agility are differentia-
tors in the market, even though what these PAs offer in
their markets is not a software product as such.

Over the years, Google as a whole has adopted software
engineering principles – monorepo, analysis tools, a rigorous
code review, CI/CD etc. – that have served all PAs well.
